#BioSD Converter to RDF

It exports the [EBI Biosamples Database](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/) into RDF files, to produce our [Linked Data end point](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/documentation/biosamples) about BioSD.

The code is based on our [java2RDF](https://github.com/EBIBioSamples/java2rdf/) library (in addition to [ZOOMA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fgpt/zooma/docs/) and [bioportal_client](https://github.com/biosemantics/bioportal-client)). Read more [here](http://www.marcobrandizi.info/mysite/node/153).
